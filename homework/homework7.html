					<div class="question">
						<h2>Task 1:</h2>
						<p>Research by loading these files on as many different browser types and versions as you can find (e.g. IE, Opera, Safari and Mozilla family). Snapshot what happens and include these images on your web site.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>So far, IE11 works well on my computer:</p>
						<image src="./homework7/snapshot/ie.PNG", alt="ie">
						<p>The newest version of Chrome and Opera doesn't work at all. Some reported that firefox is ok, but i have tried 2 versions(42 and 50) of firefox and nothing showed on my screen. Actually JAVA runs pretty well on firefox according to <a href="https://www.java.com/zh_CN/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre" target="_blank">Oracle's online test</a>. So the reason is still a mystery.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h2>Task 2:</h2>
						<p>Experiment with applet graphics (AWT and Swing). Create a simple applet to draw a red square and a green circle (hint: Use drawRect/fillRect and drawOval/fillOval methods - Sebesta has examples).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>Click <a href="./homework7/drawing.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see the result.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h2>Task 3:</h2>
						<p>Add to your applet to draw a third shape, determined by parameters passed from the HTML file that determine the shape and colour to draw. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>See the result above.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h2>Task 4:</h2>
						<p>Write a brief (<200 words) essay outlining the differences between AWT and Swing graphics.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit) is an early package which focus on drawing graphs. Actually AWT does NOT draw the graphs itself. It calls the OS GUI library instead. Because it is based on the C/C++ program, it runs fast undoubtedly, but how the graphs that drawn by AWT look like is depends on the platform. So the compatibility is the most important defect of AWT, which obviously goes against with JAVA's design philosophy.</p>
						<p>As for Swing, it procides not only all the functions that AWT gives, but also a substantial expansion with pure JAVA code. It runs slower, but gives the same result on all platform. Swing is now more recommended in JAVA.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h2>Task 5:</h2>
						<p>For additional credit: use threads to implement some sort of animation ... try moving the shapes around. Maybe you could implement a pingpong game.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>See the animation <a href="./homework7/animation.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Showing the generation of a beautiful pattern.</p>
