						<h2>Question 1:</h2>
						<p>For the three categories of web software technology we've just defined, you are asked to find out which category so-called "Netscape plug-in" technology belongs to. Please describe the basic idea of the technology, and give your reasoning on its position in the technology categories. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="answer">
						<p>I think "Netscape plug-in" technology belongs to the third category, namely Distributed Object Technology. This quote below from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI">Wikipedia</a> describes how plugins work:</p><blockquote>When the browser encounters a content type it cannot handle natively, it loads the appropriate plugin, sets aside space within the browser context for the plugin to render and then streams data to it. </blockquote> <p>Obviously this shows the interoperability between the browser and the server in spite of the space interval.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<h2>Question 2:</h2>
						<p>In a normal intercommunication between Web browser and Web Server, Web Server closes the network communication right after it sends back the document requested by the browser. Think about this statusless character of World Wide Web. Give some good points and bad points of it. Can a web server know exactly how many browsers are reading its document? </p>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>Good points:<br>
						1. This can alleviate the burden of the Server, which increaces the stability.<br>
						2. Avoiding invalid network bandwidth occupation.<br>
						3. Good for safety.
						</p>
						<p>Bad points:<br>
						1. Extra time spends on constructing connections.<br>
						2. Redundent Header should be sent between client and server in every connection.<br>
						3. Relative low response rate.
						</p>
						<p>My answer is no. Because once the connection is closed, the server has totally no information about what the client is doing now. The only thing a server can do is to record the number of browsers that have download its document.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<h2>Question 3:</h2>
						<p>Use some Web search engine to search keywords regarding your interest (even your own name to find out how famous you are in this Web World). Recommended search engines are <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">http://www.baidu.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a></p>
